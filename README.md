# Don't use this code for rolling your own Crypto system

God forbid this code ends up in someones production system...

### I'm using this repo to better understand how authentication works.

Basically I am trying to accomplish the following things:

1. Build a working authentication front end
  * Sign up
  * Email validation
  * Sign in
  * Forgot password
  * User dashboard
2. Set up the database securly
  * Hashed passwords
  * Hashed session tokens
  * Hashed forgot tokens
  * Constant time comparisons
  * Correct timeouts
  * Correct validation
3. Set up sessions correctly
  * Secure management of cookies
  * Preventing CSRF
  * Preventing XSS
4. Maybe implementing Roles

And more...
